# Design Patterns

## Creational Patterns

-   [Abstract Factory](https://github.com/osotorrio/designpatterns/tree/master/GangOfFour.Patterns/Creational/AbstractFactory): Use when your code needs to use a family of related objects and you don't want to change your code when a new familly is added to the system.
-   Builder
-   [Factory Method](https://github.com/osotorrio/designpatterns/tree/master/GangOfFour.Patterns/Creational/FactoryMethod): Use to move out of your code the responsibility and the knowledge of how to create objects.
-   Prototype
-   Singleton ?!

## Structural Patterns

-   Adapter
-   Bridge
-   [Composite](https://github.com/osotorrio/designpatterns/tree/master/GangOfFour.Patterns/Structural/Composite): Use in a hierarchical structure of objects to treat the same way individual nodes and whole branches of nodes in the tree.
-   Decorator ?!
-   Facade
-   Flyweight
-   Proxy

## Behavioral Patterns

-   Chain of Resposability ?!
-   Command
-   Interpreter
-   [Iterator](https://github.com/osotorrio/designpatterns/tree/master/GangOfFour.Patterns/Behavioral/Iterator): Use to have a common interface to access the items of different type of collections.
-   Mediator ?!
-   Memento
-   [Observer](https://github.com/osotorrio/designpatterns/tree/master/GangOfFour.Patterns/Behavioral/Observer): Use to notify a collection of objects that the internal state of another object has changed
-   State
-   Strategy
-   Template Method
-   Visitor

## General Patters

-   ModelViewViewModel
-   NullObject
-   Repository
-   Rules
-   ServiceLocator
-   Specification
-   UnitOfWork
-   Wrapper
