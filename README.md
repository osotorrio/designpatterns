# Design Patterns

## Creational Patterns

-   Abstract Factory ?!
-   Builder
-   [Factory Method](https://github.com/osotorrio/designpatterns/tree/master/GangOfFour.Patterns/Creational/FactoryMethod): Use to move out of your code the responsibility and the knowledge of how to create objects.
-   Prototype
-   Singleton ?!

## Structural Patterns

-   Adapter
-   Bridge
-   [Composite](https://github.com/osotorrio/designpatterns/tree/master/GangOfFour.Patterns/Structural/Composite): Use in a hierarchical structure of objects to treat the same way individual nodes and whole branches of nodes.
-   Decorator ?!
-   Facade
-   Flyweight
-   Proxy

## Behavioral Patterns

-   Chain of Resposability ?!
-   Command
-   Interpreter
-   Iterator
-   Mediator ?!
-   Memento
-   [Observer](https://github.com/osotorrio/designpatterns/tree/master/GangOfFour.Patterns/Behavioral/Observer): Use to notify a collection of objects that the internal state of another object has changed
-   State
-   Strategy
-   Template Method
-   Visitor

-   Repository
-   Rules
